# Going Back to Lab Report 3 #

When I did lab report 3, I researched the `grep` command and its options. This time, I'm going to research the `find` command and find some of its useful options that can further the command's efficiency in certain situations.

**The options for this command were all found on these websites: [1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-command-in-linux-with-examples/), [2](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-find-files-in-linux-using-the-command-line/), [3](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ufind.htm)
